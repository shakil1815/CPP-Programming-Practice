## 📂 Detailed Folder Structure

### 🟦 1. Basic C++
This section covers the core fundamentals of C++:
* **1. Basic:** Initial setup and hello world programs.
* **2. Conditional:** Logic building with `if-else` and `switch-case`.
* **3. Loops:** Iteration practice using `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
* **4. Pattern Printing:** Logic development through various star and number patterns.
* **5. Function:** Modularizing code using user-defined functions.
* **6. Pointers:** Understanding memory addresses and pointer arithmetic.
* **7. Recursion:** Solving problems by calling functions within themselves.
* **8. Array:** Working with 1D arrays and data collections.
* **9. 2D Array:** Handling matrices and multi-dimensional data.
* **10. String:** Manipulating text and character sequences.
