# 🚀 CPP-Programming-Practice

Welcome to my C++ learning and practice repository! This project serves as a structured collection of code snippets, concepts, and challenges I've solved while mastering C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different modules based on topics:

### 1. [Basic C++](./1.%20Basic%20C++/)
Contains fundamental concepts of C++, including:
* Variables, Data Types, and Operators
* Control Flow (if-else, switch-case)
* Loops (for, while, do-while)
* Functions and Arrays
* Pointers and Memory Management

### 2. [Object Oriented Programming (OOP)](./2.%20Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20(OOP)/)
Focuses on advanced programming paradigms:
* Classes and Objects
* Encapsulation & Abstraction
* Inheritance (Single, Multiple, Hierarchical)
* Polymorphism (Compile-time and Runtime)
* Constructors and Destructors
